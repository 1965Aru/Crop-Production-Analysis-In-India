#  Project Title : Crop-Production-Analysis-In-India

# Data Analytics Project

## Domain: Agriculture

### Problem Statement:

The Agriculture business domain, as a vital part of the overall supply chain, is expected to highly evolve in the upcoming years via the developments, that are taking place on the side of the Future Internet. This paper presents a novel Business-to-business collaboration platform from the agri-food sector perspective, which aims to facilitate the collaboration of numerous stakeholders belonging to associated business domains, effectively and flexibly.
This dataset provides a huge amount of information on crop production in India ranging from several years. Based on the Information the ultimate goal would be to predict crop production and find important insights highlighting key indicators and metrics that influence crop production.

### Tools:

- **Data Cleaning (EDA)**: Python (Pandas & Numpy)
- **Visualizations**: Python (Matplotlib , Seaborn)
- **Dashboard**: Tableau
- **IDE**: Jupiter notebook

### Data Cleaning:

Data cleaning and EDA process is done through python, Pandas libraries. Post that Bivariate and Univariate analysis is done to analyze the importance of each variable. The states are categorized based on their respective zones such as North zone, South Zone, East Zone, West Zone, North east Zone, Union territories, and central India. Different types of crops are classified into their respective categories like Cereals, Pulses, Oilseeds, Vegetables, Spices, nuts, Commercial, Fibers, Beans, and fruits. The additional columns aid us to bring more insights and highlight key indicators that influence crop production. The new data frame after data cleaning is exported into an excel file and is loaded into Tableau dashboard to build the dashboard.

### Visualizations and Insights :

Visualisation process is done through Matplotlib and Seaborn library. Finding and visualizations are done for:

- Zone wise total production
- Analyzing the state in south zone which produces the highest production
- Analyzing the district zone in Kerala which gives the highest production
- Crop wise and categorical crop wise productions
- Season wise productions
- Crop year wise productions
- Analyzing the growth of categorical crops in different seasons in different states in India
- Production of crop categories
- State that dominates in crop production by producing a variety of crop categories
- To find which crop is grown in high frequency in India and few insights are deduced and visualized
- To deduce and visualize the state that ranks high in Area wise crop production
- Top crops produced in Northern zone
- Top crops produced in Southern zone
- Top crops produced in Central zone
